# Foetal-Health-Classification-Project-YSJ
In this study 10 different classification algorithms are trained to classify and predict the health of a foetus to be Normal, Suspect or Pathological. To determine the best performing model, I observe the F1 score and implement hyperparameter tuning, feature selection and resampling to optimise model performance.
